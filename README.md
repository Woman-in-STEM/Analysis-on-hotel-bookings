# A Comprehensive Analysis on Hotel Bookings

The dataset was obtained from IBM website, a free platform that stores 
datasets for data analysis. It was extracted in CSV format. The data format is 
mixed and not pre-processed. The specific subject area of this project is 
Revenue Management.  
Each observation represents a hotel booking. Both datasets comprehend 
bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 
2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were 
cancelled. Since this is hotel real data, all data elements pertaining hotel or 
costumer identification were deleted.

### Language: Python
### Environment: Google Colab

## Data Analysis
Performed in 4 steps: <b>Data Collection</b>, <b>Data Preprocessing</b>, <b>EDA</b>, <b>Interpretation</b>

## Conclusion
<ul>
  <li>Majority of people prefer A-room type so hotels should increase their 
numbers to get more revenue. </li>
  <li>Chances of cancellation is high when there are no deposits taken by 
hotels, so hotels should take minimum deposits to minimise the rate of 
cancellation. </li>
  <li>Transient customers cancels more often but when people book in 
groups it leads to lesser cancellations, hence hotels should provide some 
offers focusing transient customers to decrease cancellations. </li>
  <li>Maximum number of bookings are in the month May to August, so 
hotels should provide exciting deal to customers to increase their 
booking in off season.</li> 
  <li>As hotels are getting less repeated customers so 
management should take customerâ€™s feedback and improve the hotel 
facilities to increase the count of their repeated guests. </li>
<li>Every year there is 25-30% cancellation for resort hotels and 40-45% 
cancellation for city hotels. </li>
</ul>
